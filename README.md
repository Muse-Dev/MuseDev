# Muse-Dev

MuseDev delivers a DevOps-native analysis platform that helps developers find
and fix their most elusive bugs. MuseDev orchestrates code analysis to
automatically run at each pull-request and deliver results as comments during
code review. By integrating into developersâ€™ existing workflow, Muse helps teams
write their best code.

The [Github app](https://github.com/apps/muse-dev) is currently in closed beta.
Please contact us at hello@muse.dev to enter the trial.

# MuseDev C Examples

MuseDev is a code analysis system that aids developers during code review.
Working in concert with repository hosting systems, such as GitHub, Muse acts on
each pull request analyzing the code for defects and posting the results as
comments inline with the repository host.

This repository contains everything needed to see Muse in action, including a
simple C program and a set of branches that introduce bugs. Each branch can be
used to create a pull request that Muse will analyze. Simply follow the steps
for your repository host listed below. These examples serve both as a smoke-test
that you are accepted to our private beta and to demonstrate user workflow.
