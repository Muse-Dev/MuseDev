# Muse-Dev

MuseDev delivers a DevOps-native code analysis platform that helps developers find
and fix their most elusive bugs. MuseDev orchestrates code analysis to
automatically run at each pull-request and deliver results as comments during
code review. By integrating into developersâ€™ existing workflow, Muse helps teams
write their best code.
